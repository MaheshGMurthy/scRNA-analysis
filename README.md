GSE126321 dataset was downloaded from NCBI-GEO database. The dataset had 3 samples GM18502, GM12878 and GSM3596322. 
scRNA-seq data was analsyed using the Seurat package. Raw data was imported using Read10X function. 
Seurat objective was created having a threshold of atleast 200 genes per cell and genes detected in at least 3 cells.
As for the QC mitochondrial gene content was calculated to identify the low-quality cells and cells with high mitochondrial RNA content (dead cells or cell stress). 
Cells with lesser 5% mitochondrial RNA was retained and between 200 to 2500 detected genes resulting in a clean dataset for further analysis. 
Data was then normalised using the lognormalise function from Seuratâ€™s, followed by the identification of highly variable features. 
Data was scaled up for linear dimensionality reduction (PCA) and clustering followed by nonlinear dimensionality reduction (UMAP)
